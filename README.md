Some notes about my dayz standalone 1.0 gamplay I thought I'd share these on the interwebs.

### Day time tips

### Night time tips

- Avoid night raiding initially.
- Do not use the emergency fire torch you will be seen from clicks away.
- When using glowsticks be ready to drop them (default key G) and switch to melee if you need to take down a zombie

### Water tips

- There's a nice accessible water pump in the villiage to the north of the south-cost military tents.
- The village to the East of Elektro around a T split (short end towards the sea) has a police station and in front of it a water pump.
- The village in the South-Eastern corner of the map but on a hill (not near the sea) there is a water pump in the garden of a red building.

### Survival tips

- Go look for water/drinks instantly.
- Food also recovers some thirst because food has quite some water in it.

### Zombie tips

- You can kill zombies by hand one at a time. More are difficult to handle.
- DO NOT SHOOT GUNS UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Zombies from many meters away will come running towards you.
- Keep a melee weapon in slot 1.
- Keep your right click ready to go in fighting stance with your melee weapon.
- Keep bandages in slot 2.
- If you're bleeding after a fight bandage yourself as quickly as possible.
- Zombies can't seem to open doors right now. If you keep quite for about 5 minutes they will wander off and forget you're in the house.
- For houses with multiple entrances be sure to close all doors.
