# dayznotes
Some notes about my dayz standalone 1.0 gamplay I thought I'd share these on the interwebs.

### Day time tips

### Night time tips

- Avoid night looting initially unless you really have to. The darkness is an extra difficulty in handling zombies/other players and I find it harder to manage. You can use the darkness to navigate (mostly safely) through the forests.
- Do not use the emergency fire torch you will be seen from clicks away.
- When using glowsticks be ready to drop them (default key G) and switch to melee if you need to take down a zombie

### Water tips

- Food also recovers some thirst because food has quite some water in it.
- There's a nice accessible water pump in the villiage to the north of the south-cost military tents.
- The village to the East of Elektro around a T split (short end towards the sea) has a police station and in front of it a water pump.
- The village in the South-Eastern corner of the map but on a hill (not near the sea) there is a water pump in the garden of a red building.
- The tiny village a quite a bit south-east of a Big radio tower (next to a smaller one and couple of old tanks) has a water pump close to a house and a tree whith not too much zombies nearby. Neighboring village more South western (with bigger houses) has a pond.
- Most villages seem to have a water pump, but they're not always easy to spot.
- If you really have to you can drink unfiltered/cleaned water from ponds.
- If you have some bottle or cooking pot with you you can fill it for some thirst relief. Add some chlorine tablets ideally if you got your water from a dirty source.

### Survival tips

- Go look for water/drinks instantly.
- Food also recovers some thirst because food has quite some water in it.
- In forests, near trees and in sheds often there grow some eatable mushrooms ready for a quick snack. (I'm not aware of poisenous ones just yet.)
- In the wild there roam packs of wolvles which can attack you. Be prepared with sufficient bandages/weapons/ammo/torches?? I have yet to surives wolve encounters.

### Zombie tips

- You often hear zombies before you can see them (especially at night), pay close attention to there grunts.
- You can kill zombies by hand one at a time. More are difficult to handle.
- DO NOT SHOOT GUNS UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Zombies from many meters away will come running towards you.
- Keep a melee weapon in slot 1.
- Keep your right click ready to go in fighting stance with your melee weapon.
- Keep bandages in slot 2.
- If you're bleeding after a fight bandage yourself as quickly as possible.
- Zombies can't seem to open doors right now. If you keep quite for about 5 minutes they will wander off and forget you're in the house.
- For houses with multiple entrances be sure to close all doors.
- Zombies sometimes have some loot as well.
- Zombies are more vulnerable from the back, with some melee weapons you can even kill them in one accurate hit.
- Zombies have been sighted chasing goats at high speed instead of their usual pace.

### Resource gathering tips

- Some bushes have tasty berries in them once you cut them down with an axe/machete/...
- With a shovel you can dig for worms you can eat in an emergency.
- If you dropped some stuff and it seems stuck in a tree you can cut down the tree to get it out again.
- You can get stones using a sledgehamme (and probably pickaxe) on any big rock.
- You can find some small stones on hiking trails.

### Crafting tips

- You can create a campfire by combine a stick with a rag/paper/bark, lighting it with matches and feeding the fire pieces of short/large wood cut from trees with an axe/hatchet.
- Making/using fishing net? Dunno how to use nets yet. -
- You can craft a fishing hook from the bones of a slaughtered animal with a hunting knife.
- You can add worms, dug up with a shovel, to the fishing hook. Haven't been able to fish yet. Maybe with sewing kit?
- Growing seeds is started by digging a growing patch with a shovel. Add any found seeds to it and give the patch a good bunch of water till it starts to grow. You can find "Garden Lime" fertilizer in sheds sometimes, which can be added to the growing patch for quicker/beter results probably. I've been able to grow tomatos and pumpkins in a one or two ingame days.

### Hunting tips
- You can't cook with just a pot an some steak. What do you need then? Campfire tripod? Water?

### Maintenance tips.

Everything wears down even your favorite gear
- You can mend backbacks with a leather sewing kit.
- You can fix clothes with a regular sewing kit.
- You can clean your guns with a gun cleaning kit.

### Gun tips
- Guns are loud and will attract a lot of attention from both zombies and humans.
- Even if you manage to find a silencer they sometimes seem bugged causing them not to work.
