# dayznotes
Some notes about my dayz standalone 1.0 gamplay I thought I'd share these on the interwebs.

## Prelude

I don't know how many days it's been I lost count but this day is the first I'll writes something different than the practicalities below. I managed to make a friend, Horatio, many days ago. With this friend I managed to repair an old Olga car. The first time driving it was amazing. We looted many neighboring villages, had our wheels stolen and after hours upon hours of work we got everything need to repair it and drive off, to a safer location, we thought. Even trying to protect our valuable asset there is only so much you can do to prevent thieves from stealing a car without any locks. We were still building  It's gone now. A loss, for me and Horatio. A loss in an already barren land, we managed to survive somehow this virus but a car couldn't last. The survivors are almost as cruel to eachother as the zombies (can zombies drive a car? I suspect not but after seeing them chasing goats and killing a wolf I'm not sure anymore).

I'm looking over the city now, hoping for a trace of the car. I haven't seen Horatio in a while, he said he'd be back and not drive off without me, I hope he will be back and went to explore. But I'm afraid it's only that, hope.


## Muhtips

### Day time tips

### Night time tips

- Avoid night looting initially unless you really have to. The darkness is an extra difficulty in handling zombies/other players and I find it harder to manage. You can use the darkness to navigate (mostly safely) through the forests.
- Do not use the emergency fire torch you will be seen from half a click away (litterally you can spot the it 500m away I tested that).
- When using glowsticks be ready to drop them (default key G) and switch to melee if you need to take down a zombie (this also gives your battlefield some useful light).
- Use the slots in combination with your ligthsource wisely. Swapping to a melee weapon can be useful to quickly dim your light but your battery will drain when your lightsource is in your backpack so don't forget to turn it off in time.

### Water tips

- Food also recovers some thirst because food has quite some water in it.
- There's a nice accessible water pump in the villiage to the north of the south-cost military tents.
- The village to the East of Elektro around a T split (short end towards the sea) has a police station and in front of it a water pump.
- The village in the South-Eastern corner of the map but on a hill (not near the sea) there is a water pump in the garden of a red building.
- The tiny village a quite a bit south-east of a Big radio tower (next to a smaller one and couple of old tanks) has a water pump close to a house and a tree whith not too much zombies nearby. Neighboring village more South western (with bigger houses) has a pond.
- Most villages seem to have a water pump, but they're not always easy to spot.
- If you really have to you can drink unfiltered/cleaned water from ponds.
- If you have some bottle or cooking pot with you you can fill it for some thirst relief. Add some chlorine tablets ideally if you got your water from a dirty source.

### Survival tips

- Go look for water/drinks instantly.
- Food also recovers some thirst because food has quite some water in it.
- In forests, near trees and in sheds often there grow some eatable mushrooms ready for a quick snack. (I'm not aware of poisenous ones just yet.)
- In the wild there roam packs of wolvles which can attack you. Again you'll hear them before you see them. Be prepared with sufficient bandages/weapons/ammo/torches?? ~~I have yet to surives wolve encounters.~~ When I heared howling I stayed close to buildings. Then a single wolf came to pick on some zombies, the zombies managed to kill the first wolf. After getting me some nice wolf steak and heading out a second wolf appeared, but now prepared, I quickly killed it with my revolver. I think the dead of two of theirs fended of the rest of the pack appearing. 

### Zombie tips

- You often hear zombies before you can see them (especially at night), pay close attention to there grunts.
- You can kill zombies by hand one at a time. More are difficult to handle.
- DO NOT SHOOT GUNS UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Zombies from many meters away will come running towards you.
- Keep a melee weapon in slot 1.
- Keep your right click ready to go in fighting stance with your melee weapon.
- Keep bandages in slot 2.
- If you're bleeding after a fight bandage yourself as quickly as possible.
- Zombies can't seem to open doors right now. If you keep quite for about 5 minutes they will wander off and forget you're in the house.
- For houses with multiple entrances be sure to close all doors.
- Zombies sometimes have some loot as well.
- Zombies are more vulnerable from the back, with some melee weapons you can even kill them in one accurate hit.
- Zombies have been sighted chasing goats at high speed instead of their usual pace.

### Resource gathering tips

- Some bushes have tasty berries in them once you cut them down with an axe/machete/...
- With a shovel you can dig for worms you can eat in an emergency.
- If you dropped some stuff and it seems stuck in a tree you can cut down the tree to get it out again.
- You can get stones using a sledgehamme (and probably pickaxe) on any big rock.
- You can find some small stones on hiking trails.
- You can get a long stick using a knife on a bush.

### Crafting tips

- You can create a campfire by combine a stick with a rag/paper/bark, lighting it with matches and feeding the fire pieces of short/large wood cut from trees with an axe/hatchet.
- Making/using fishing net? Dunno how to use nets yet. -
- You can craft a fishing hook from the bones of a slaughtered animal with a hunting knife.
- You can add worms, dug up with a shovel, to the fishing hook. Haven't been able to fish yet. Maybe with sewing kit?
- Growing seeds is started by digging a growing patch with a shovel. Add any found seeds to it and give the patch a good bunch of water till it starts to grow. You can find "Garden Lime" fertilizer in sheds sometimes, which can be added to the growing patch for quicker/beter results probably. I've been able to grow tomatos and pumpkins in a one or two ingame days.
- You can tan hides right now but can't do anything with the tanned leather yet. You need a barel, water and Garden Lime to tan.

### Hunting tips
- You can't cook with just a pot an some steak. What do you need then? Campfire tripod? Water?
- You can cook raw steaks using a long stick.

### Maintenance tips

Everything wears down even your favorite gear. If things get ruined they become un-repairable and you can't repair things any more beyond being worn.
- You can mend backbacks with a leather sewing kit.
- You can fix clothes with a regular sewing kit.
- You can clean your guns with a gun cleaning kit.
- You can fix your electric devices (e.g. trancievers) with an electrical repair kit
- You can fix a lot of stuff with trusty ol' duct-tape.

### Gun tips
- Guns are loud and will attract a lot of attention from both zombies and humans.
- Even if you manage to find a silencer they sometimes seem bugged causing them not to work.

### Car tips
Getting all the parts to fix up a car takes a lot of effort. Teaming up with trustees is highly advised.
- You can use the trunk of the car as a large storage.
- You need a tire iron to put the wheels on the car.
- Know what type of car you are fixing, each car has specific doors, trunks and wheels.
- You need at least two jerrycans: one for fuel, one for water for the car radiator.
- The refill interaction spots are pretty tiny pay close attention when hodling the appropriately filled jerrycan.
- You can drive a car without it's doors.


### Tool tips

- Lockpick kits can lock doors but they get unlocked once the server restarts.
- Hacksaws can be used to make small planks from large piles at lumberyards or construction sites.
- Axes can be used to cut down trees/bushes anywhere, for fire, construction and tools.
