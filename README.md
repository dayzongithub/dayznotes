### Day time tips

### Night time tips

- Avoid night raiding initially.
- Do not use the emergency fire torch you will be seen from clicks away.
- When using glowsticks be ready to drop them (default key G) and switch to melee if you need to take down a zombie
- You can kill zombies by hand one at a time. More are difficult to handle.

### Water tips

- There's a nice accessible water pump in the villiage to the north of the south-cost military tents.
- The village to the East of Elektro around a T split (short end towards the sea) has a police station and in front of it a water pump.
- The village in the South-Eastern corner of the map but on a hill (not near the sea) there is a water pump in the garden of a red building.

### Survival tips

- Go look for water/drinks instantly.
- Food also recovers some thirst because food has quite some water in it.
